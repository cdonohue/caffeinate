# Caffeinate :coffee:
> An [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app that keeps your machine awake

This app is heavily inspired by [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) and aims to provide close to the same experience _and_ support retina screens.

Simply click the icon in your menu bar to caffeinate!
